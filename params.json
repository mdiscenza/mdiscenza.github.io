{"name":"Michael Discenza","tagline":"My home on the internet for now","body":"### About\r\nA business-minded statistician/data scientist looking for challenging data problems to solve a wide range of fields. I am as comfortable in client-focused roles(front end web client and real breathing people clients) and strategic as I am writing code and building statistical models, but prefer to split my time between those two activities. \r\n\r\nI am recently finished a masters degree in statistics at Columbia, focusing mainly on machine learning. I have a background in social science research and passion for using computing for social good.  \r\n\r\nAvailable for freelance data analysis/statistical programming and portrait or event photography.\r\n\r\nMy photographic work can be found at [mdiscenza.tumblr.com](mdiscenza.tumblr.com) and [www.zenfolio.com/mdiscenza/](www.zenfolio.com/mdiscenza/)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
